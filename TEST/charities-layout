[html format="ckeditor" different_values="0"]<p></p><h2>Want to game for big prizes while helping others?</h2>Here's how it works. Join a GFCâ„¢ tournament and compete for cash and bragging rights. We direct 15% of the proceeds from each tournament to the best non-profit organizations we can find, all fighting with a common cause: to alleviate the financial burden that comes with battling a cancer diagnosis. Or, If you prefer, you can also donate directly anytime and <strong>100%</strong> of your donation will be forwarded on behalf of our common cause.<p></p><p>Our approach is simple. The majority of entry fees are returned as prizes, the next 15% goes directly to the cause. The remaining portion keeps the operation growing so we can become the <strong>premier online destination for competitive gamers</strong>. It's a big goal, but we're in it for the long haul. No one is more serious about gaming than we are. We pride ourselves on fair play, great service and hard-core fun. We already have thousands of gamers competing in our tournaments. Jump in and we promise you will have a quality experience and feel great about it, knowing that because we are fighting to knock cancer offline, everybody wins.</p><p>Here are just a few organizations we have discovered in our quest to aid other cancer patients and their families in need. If you know of a great charity helping those currently battling cancer, please tell us about it at <a href="mailto:Suzanne@playgfc.com?subject=Charity%20Suggestion">Suzanne@playgfc.com</a> </p><p>&nbsp;</p>[/html]
